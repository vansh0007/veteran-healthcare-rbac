# Testing with cURL

1. Create Admin User (First Time Setup)
```
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/users \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "admin@veteran.org",
    "password": "Admin@123",

```
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "admin@veteran.org",
    "password": "Admin@123"
  }'

  ```
Save the returned access_token for subsequent requests.

  -d '{
    "email": "veteran@example.com",
    "password": "Veteran@123",
    "firstName": "James",
    "lastName": "Smith",
    "roles": [{"role": "veteran"}]
  }'

```

5. Login as Healthcare Provider

  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "doctor@veteran.org",
    "password": "Doctor@123"
  }'
```

6. Access Restricted Endpoints

# As admin - List all users
```
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/users \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ADMIN_TOKEN"
```

# As provider - Will fail (403 Forbidden)
```
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/users \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_PROVIDER_TOKEN"
```

Sample Data Structure
Roles Available
admin - System administrator

provider - Healthcare provider (requires organizationId)

veteran - Veteran user

staff - Support staff (requires organizationId)

# Organization Structure
json
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "VA Medical Center",
  "address": "123 Healthcare Ave",
  "phone": "555-123-4567"
}

# Troubleshooting

Database connection issues:

# Verify PostgreSQL container is running: 

docker ps

Check logs: docker-compose logs postgres

# Migration errors:

Run: npm run migration:revert then npm run migration:run

# Authentication problems:

Verify JWT_SECRET in .env matches

Check token expiration (default 60 minutes)

# UserRole

## Access Control Implementation

* Key Components

# Role-Based Guards:

1. RolesGuard checks if user has required roles

2. Decorators like @Roles(Role.ADMIN) define endpoint requirements

# Permission Checking:

1. Hierarchical checks (org parent/child relationships)

2. Direct role assignments

3. ole inheritance (admin inherits viewer permissions)

# Data Filtering:

1.Repository patterns filter data based on users roles

2. Organization hierarchy considered in queries

## JWT Integration:

Roles embedded in JWT for quick validation

Refresh token implementation recommended for production

## Permission Flow
User authenticates, receives JWT with roles

Request hits endpoint with @Roles() decorator

RolesGuard validates JWT and checks roles

Service layer applies additional data filtering

Repository fetches only authorized data

## Future Considerations

# Complex Scenarios

* Temporary Access:

1.Add expiration to role assignments

2. Implement delegation workflows

3. Fine-Grained Permissions:

4. Resource-specific permissions (e.g., read/write)

5. Attribute-based access control (ABAC) integration

# Advanced Hierarchy:

1. Multi-level organization trees

2. Cross-organization collaborations

# Security Enhancements

* Audit Logging:

1. Comprehensive logging of all access attempts

2. Integration with SIEM systems

# Rate Limiting:

1.Protect against brute force attacks

2. Implement on sensitive endpoints

# Data Encryption:

1. Field-level encryption for sensitive data

2. Key management system integration

## Performance Optimizations

* Caching Layer:

1. Cache permission checks for frequent users

2. Redis integration for distributed caching

# Optimized Queries:

1.Materialized views for common access patterns

2.Database indexing strategy for large datasets

# Batch Processing:

1. Bulk permission checks for batch operations

2. Asynchronous permission validation where possible

# Additional Features

1.Self-Service Portal:

2. Allow users to request elevated access

3. Approval workflows

# Multi-Factor Authentication:

1.  Required for sensitive operations

2. Integration with existing veteran auth systems

# API Gateway Integration:

1.Centralized access control

2. Request transformation based on roles

## Design Decisions

# Database Choice:

1. PostgreSQL for production (scalability, JSON support)

2. SQLite option for development simplicity

# Hierarchy Implementation:

1. Materialized Path pattern for organizations

2. Balance between query performance and update complexity

# JWT Approach:

1. Include essential roles in token

2. Periodic refresh to sync permission changes

# Testing Strategy:

1.Unit tests for core logic

2.Integration tests for API endpoints

3. E2E tests for critical user flows

# Error Handling:

1.Consistent error responses

2. No sensitive data in error messages
